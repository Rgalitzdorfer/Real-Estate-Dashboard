# Real Estate Dashboard Overview
In collaboration with Monroe County Appraisal Associates (MCAA), this project builds an application that allows users to quickly and accurately evaluate several metrics for unique counties, towns, school districts, and timeframes within the Greater Rochester Area. All real estate data since 2018 was originally downloaded and concatenated from the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), a database that tracks every sale within New York. Useful metrics were cleaned and standardized to ensure accurate results for each selection. Users can select from the following 4 Drop-Down options:
1. County
2. Town
3. School District
4. Timeframe (Used for Time Series Analysis)
5 Outputs from Drop-Down Selections:
1. Closed Sales (Tracks Number of Sales)
2. Median Price
3. Average Price
4. Days on Market (Tracks Buyer demand)
5. Sales Price/List Price (Tracks Willingness to Pay Above 'Market Price')
Each output provides results from the above drop-down menu with an accompanying graph, utilizing the selected timeframe to perform a time series analysis on any given combination of county, town, and school district. This analytic tool expedites every appraisal report's 'Neighborhood Evaluation' section by providing a condensed bundle of information to evaluate market conditions. It may also be used to identify trending neighborhoods within the local real estate market, giving homebuyers the necessary information to make informed decisions.
